# fun_with_word_docs
Share the joy of APis with your office document friends

**Research**
- For Python and R the modules/library is docx and officer (or ReporteRs) respectively.
- Just add an API source data and have some fun.

**R**
officer is good but needs starting document with boilerplate header and footer content
