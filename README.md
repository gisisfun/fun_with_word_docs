# fun_with_word_docs
Share the joy of APis with your office document friends

**Research**
- For Python and R the modules/library is *docx* and *officer* (or *ReporteRs*) respectively.
- Just add an API source data and have some fun.

**R**
The R library *officer* is good but needs starting document with templated header and footer content.

**Next Steps**
- Code an existing paper form to JSON Format.
